hello! this is my repository that is named accordingly. in this short spork guide, i will tell you all types of sporks. the first is a normal sppon and fork spork, rated 7/10, a reliable tool. the second is the long spork. combining forks, spoons and knives, good for meat but other than that a bit too long for average use 6/10. the final spork we will talk about is the fork spork. this fork dominant spork has longer fork prongs, smaller spoon scoop and a small cutting edge. in terms of usability, perfect for most situations 9/10 for most dinners, but soups take away the extra point.
